- **Configure Parameters**: Customize SSH settings such as port, root login, allowed users, and connection limits.  
- **Set Permissions**: Secure SSH configuration file with appropriate ownership and permissions.  
- **Update Banner**: Add a custom MOTD (Message of the Day) for system access warnings.  
- **Restart SSH Service**: Apply the new configuration.

## Step 4: Install and Configure UFW Firewall  
- **Install UFW**: Set up a firewall to manage traffic.  
- **Reset Rules**: Clear existing configurations for a clean start.  
- **Allow Specific Ports**: Open SSH and DNS ports for connectivity.  
- **Set Default Policies**: Reject incoming traffic and allow outgoing by default.

## Step 5: Install and Configure Docker  
- **Add GPG Key and Repository**: Integrate Dockerâ€™s official GPG key and repository.  
- **Update and Install**: Refresh repositories and install Docker packages.  
- **Start Service**: Ensure Docker is running and enabled on startup.  
- **Add User to Docker Group**: Grant non-root user access to Docker.
